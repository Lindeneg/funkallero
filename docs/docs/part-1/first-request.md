# First Request

## Start Server

`yarn start`

`npm run start`

## Send Request

Make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:3000/user` however you please, via `cURL`, `postman` or the browser even, what ever works.

The response should have the array made in section four:

`['user-1', 'user-2', 'user-3']`

## Next Steps

Go to the advanced section where we transform this basic example into a more usable API.
