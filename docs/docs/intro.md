# Funkallero - What is it?

I quite like developing web APIs using mediator pattern and dependency injection. Funkallero is effectively a wrapper on top of [Express](https://expressjs.com) that enforces those patterns with strong type safety.

The structure of consuming projects are then encouraged to follow the principles of clean architecture and command-query-segregation but neither of those are actually enforced.

Since the framework is still in its infancy, features are missing, performance is not optimized and tests are lacking.

This is all just a bit of **fun**.. and I had loads of that!

Needless to say, for anything serious, please use [Express](https://expressjs.com) directly or [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), both of which are infinitely superior.

## Example

There's a tutorial on this site, where most features are covered. Give it a spin, perhaps you'll like it.

There's also an example application [available](https://github.com/Lindeneg/funkallero/tree/master/example).
