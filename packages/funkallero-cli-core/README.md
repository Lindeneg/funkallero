# funkallero-cli-core

A [plopjs](https://github.com/plopjs/plop) wrapper. As with most things I build, it's just a bit of fun but for me specifically, it does at least add some value.

This wrapper is consumed by [funkallero-cli](https://github.com/lindeneg/funkallero/tree/master/packages/funkallero-cli) to scaffold new projects, add modules to existing projects etc.

This wrapper is not specific to Funkallero as such and could be used to create any scaffolding CLI.

##### Install

`yarn install @lindeneg/funkallero-cli-core`
